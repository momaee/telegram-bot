# Telegram Bot

This repository contains code for a Telegram Bot that can interact with users on the Telegram platform. The bot is built using Golang and connects to the Telegram API via the `telegram-bot-api` library. This bot is also connected to ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, to enable it to respond to a wider range of user inputs.
